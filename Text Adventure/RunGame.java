/*
 * Peng Fei Dong
 * Period 4
 * ~2 hours
 * 
 * This Lab/Project was split across multiple days, so the total time taken is unknown.
 * However, I completed this lab twice, once before wednesday february 21st and once 
 * afterwards. It wasn't hard, just very long and very tiresome. I feel that this was
 * a good lab for the current project, but it still for some reason feels out of place.
 * Nonetheless, I finished the lab, I didn't get stuck that much, and it was fun imbuing myself
 * into some of the World.prints that I did over the course of the lab.
